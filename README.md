# TopRecipes

This gem is a CLI to browse through the latest recipes on food2fork with some humor involved.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_recipes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_recipes

## Usage

Run the gem, and ask her to list you recipes with the 'list recipes' command. And look into the details of the recipe by pressing the recipe number. Ask her to tell you a joke. Happy Cooking :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
