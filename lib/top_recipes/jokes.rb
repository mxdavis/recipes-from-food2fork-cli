    "This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had
    died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years
    mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise.
    When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their
    mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master
    bath suite and Jacuzzi.
    As they 'oohed and aahed' the old man asked Peter how much all
    this was going to cost.
    'It's free,' Peter replied, 'this is Heaven.'
    Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course
    that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges
    everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing
    the great golf courses on earth.
    The old man asked, 'What are the green fees?'.
    Peter's reply, 'This is heaven, you play for free.'
    Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch
    with the cuisines of the world laid out.
    'How much to eat?' asked the old man.
    'Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!' Peter replied
    with some exasperation.
    'Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?' the old
    man asked timidly.
    Peter lectured, 'That's the best part...you can eat as much as you
    like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get
    sick. This is Heaven.'
    With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his
    hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly.
    Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was
    wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, 'This is all your fault.

    is sitting there he notices this bowl of peanuts beside her bed and takes
    one. As they talk, he can't help himself and eats one after another.
    By the time they are through talking, the bowl is empty. He says,
    'Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I seem to have eaten all of your peanuts.'
    'That's okay,' she says. 'They would have just sat there. Without my
    teeth, all I can do is suck the chocolate off and put them back.'",
    "Did you hear about the new Chinese Cookbook being sold only at pet stores?

    '101 Ways to Wok Your Dog'", 
    "A businessman had arranged an important formal dinner party at
    his home where they were going to serve stuffed whole baked fish
    as the main course. While the guests were eating the appetizer, the
    cook came to the host and whispered 'Please come urgently to the
    kitchen.' The host went to the kitchen where the cook explained that
    while she was serving the starter, the cat ate a big chunk of the fish
    which they were going to serve. The host said, 'Just fill the hole
    with stuffing and turn the other side up, nobody will notice.'
    The fish was served and when they were nearly finished eating, the
    host was again called to the kitchen. The cook said, 'The cat is dead!'
    The host rushed back to the dinner party and apologized, 'Something
    was wrong with the fish and everyone must have their stomachs pumped
    out at the hospital.' When they came back everything was still fine
    and the host went to ask the cook, 'Where is the cat?'
    'Oh,' said the chef, 'The cat is still by the road where the
    truck ran it down!'"
